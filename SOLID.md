## Acronym
S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

# Single Responsibility


# Open Closed 
"Software entities such as classes, modules, functions, etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification"

new functionality should be implemented by adding new classes, attributes, and methods instead of modifying existing ones

> Implementation Guidelines
- simplest implementation of Open Closed Principle is derived classes

> If OCP is not used
-  End up testing entire functionality along with the new requirement
-  QA Team need to test the entire flow
-  Costly for the org
-  Breaks the single responsibility principle
-  Harder to maintain classes

# Liskov Substitution


# Interface Segregation
Objects should only depend upon methods they're going to use

break up massive interfaces into multiple smaller interfaces


# Dependency Inversio
